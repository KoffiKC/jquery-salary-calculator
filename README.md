# Company Employee Cost Calculator

## Description

With this App, you can get the total monthly cost of all employees. Simply type in their information and the app will display them on the page, calculate their monthly income and add it to the total monthly cost. If the total monthly cost goes above 20,000 the total cost will turn red indicating that budget cuts are needed!
